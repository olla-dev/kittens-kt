# kittens-kt
Random kitten image fetcher app

This implementations is based on this clean architecture template I build a while ago: 
[kotlin-clean-architecture-bare-template](https://github.com/olla-dev/kotlin-clean-architecture-bare-template)

It uses the following libraries:

* Jetpack compose for the UI
* Dagger Hilt for dependency injection
* Room for the ORM

It is a little bit over engineered for the required app but It is a good base for a more complicated app.
